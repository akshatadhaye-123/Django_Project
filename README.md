# Django_Project
I have developed Pizza Ordering System project using Django framework. In which there are two apps userapp and adminapp. For user it is compulsory to sign up before login. User can see all pizzas and its details. They can add the pizzas to the cart as well as remove or update the no. of pizzas in a cart. After the payment is done the card pizza removed and total amount becomes zero. If the user tried to add pizza to the cart without login he will be redirected to login page. Admin can add new categories and new pizzas. I have used db. SQLite database to store the modelâ€™s information.
